# addToCart

For sending details of which products (or SKUs within products) the shopper is adding to their cart.

You must only include the products or SKUs that the shopper is adding to their cart during this event, not the products or SKUs the cart has after this event occurs.

## Example

```swift
// Create instance of tracker
let customerId = "<your-customer-id>"
let area = "<your-area>"
// Represents a shopper who is not logged in
let login = Login(loggedIn: false, username: nil)
let tracker = GbTracker(customerId: customerId, area: area, login: login)

// Code below assumes a tracker has been created called "tracker"

// Prepare price for product
let price = Price(actual: "12.34", currency: "usd", onSale: true, regular: "23.45")

// Prepare product for cart item
let product = Product(category: "abc123", collection: "abc123", id: "abc123", price: price, sku: "abc123", title: "abc123")

// Prepare cart item for list of cart items
let item = CartItem(product: product, quantity: 1)

// Prepare list of cart items for cart
let items = [item]

// Prepare cart for event
let cart = Cart(items: items, type: "abc123")

// Prepare event for beacon
let event = AddToCartEvent(cart: cart, googleAttributionToken: "abc123")

// Prepare beacon for request
let beacon = AddToCartBeacon(event: event, experiments: nil, metadata: nil)

// Use tracker instance to send beacon
tracker.sendAddToCartEvent(addToCartBeacon: beacon) { error in
    guard error == nil else {
        var msg = "Failed to send beacon: " + (error?.localizedDescription ?? "")
        guard let gbError = error as? GbError else {
            print(msg)
            return
        }
        switch gbError {
            case .error(let code, let errorDetails, let innerError):
                guard let errorDetails = errorDetails else {
                    msg += "; network or other error: " +
                String(code) + " " + (innerError?.localizedDescription ?? "")
                    print(msg)
                    return
                }
                if (errorDetails.jsonSchemaValidationErrors.count > 0)
                {
                    for validationError in errorDetails.jsonSchemaValidationErrors {
                        msg += "; validation errors: " + validationError
                    }
                }
                break
        }
        print(msg)
        return
    }

    let msg = "Sent beacon successfully."
    print(msg)
}
```

In the real world, you should re-use your tracker instance across the lifetime of your app, not create a new instance each time you want to send a beacon. These code examples create new tracker instances each time for demonstration purposes.
